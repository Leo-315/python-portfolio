# Project: AI Test Score Prediction Model

## Problem
The goal of this project is to see if a computer can predict a student's test score
based on how many hours they studied and how much sleep they got. 
## Solution
I created a dataset using Google Sheets that includes hours studied, hours slept,
and test scores for multiple students. I then used Python and a learning model from scikit-learn to train the AI on this data. After training,
the model can predict a test score for a new student based on their study and sleep time.
## Tools Used
- Python
- Thonny
- Pandas library
- Scikit-learn library
- Google Sheets (for creating the dataset)
## How to Run the Project
1. Create a Google Sheet with columns for Hours_Studied, Hours_Slept, and Test_Score.
2. Add about 10–15 rows of realistic data and download it as **data.csv**.
3. Place the file in the same folder as **model.py**.(Create the folder somewhere that's easy to access)
4. Run **model.py** in Thonny.
5. The program will display a predicted test score in the console.
## Results
The trained AI model successfully predicts a test score for a student
based on their study and sleep hours.
## What I Learned
I learned how machine learning models are trained using real data, how to use
Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, and how to publish a coding
project on GitHub.
